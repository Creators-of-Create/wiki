# Getting Started

Thank you for choosing Create! Here's some guidance for your first steps in the Create mod.

## Core concepts

Create revolves around two main concepts: [Rotational Power] and [Contraptions].

**Rotational Power** is Create's energy system, used to power [Machines] and Contraptions, and is generated by [Hand Cranks], [Water Wheels], [Windmill Bearings] and [Steam Engines]. RP is transfered by using [Shafts], [Cogs], [Belts], and more recently, [Chain Conveyors]!

**Contraptions** are game entities built by the player that are able to shape the world around them. These entities are made from regular blocks and Machines, and are characterized by which kind of anchor they use. Some examples of anchor include [Mechanical Bearings], [Elevator Pulleys] and [Trains].

With a combination of these you can automate pretty much the entire game
