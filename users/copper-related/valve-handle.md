## Usage

The Valve Handle functions much like the Hand Crank, though the amount and direction it rotates with one use can be adjusted in its Value Settings Screen. This may be useful for Contraptions that require a certain orientation to function. The direction of rotation can also be inverted from the Valve's settings by sneak using the Valve Handle instead of using it.

The valve handle can be dyed all 16 vanilla colors by right clicking it with the respective Dye.
