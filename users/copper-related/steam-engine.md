# Steam Engine

The Steam Engine is a block that provides Rotational Force. It outputs the highest Stress Unit (SU) capacity of all the survival-mode power-generating blocks. It converts the pressure caused by heating Water in a Fluid Tank into Rotational Force, allowing for large scale item production and multiple contraptions.

## Usage

Steam Engines use heated Water for power and are placed on Fluid Tanks, which are then used as a boiler. At least 4 Fluid Tanks and 4 heat sources are required. A Shaft can be used on the engine to create a kinetic output. The direction of said output can be adjusted through the Value Settings on the side of the engine.

Increasing the total power generated requires that one or more of the three characteristics (heat, size, water) of the Fluid Tank boiler be increased. This will increase the boiler's level, increasing the maximum amount of SU Steam Engines are capable of generating from the boiler. A single Steam Engine can only extract up to 16,384 SU (The equivalent of 1 boiler level). To combat this, multiple Steam Engines can be attached to a single boiler to extract more power; however, this will not increase the total power generated by the boiler.

### Boiler Size

The tank size is the basic characteristic of a steam boiler. The required dimensions are affected by the heat supplied. For a passive steam engine (level 0) the boiler must be a 2x2 fluid tank of preferably one block height (making it any higher will be a waste of resources). For an active steam engine (level 1 or higher) the boiler must have 4 blocks per heat level. For example, a level 1 boiler must have a tank made of at least 4 fluid tank blocks, a level 9 boiler must be made of at least 36 blocks and a level 18 boiler (maximum achievable) must be at least made of 72 blocks.

### Heat

A steam boiler requires heat to function. Heat sources must be placed underneath the boiler tank in order to affect it. All passive heat sources generate the same amount of heat. More power can be generated with the help of Blaze Burners, which produce varying amounts of heat depending on their state. Adding additional fluid tanks and increasing water input can also generate more power. At higher power levels, more Steam Engines are required to extract rotational power from the boiler.

### Water

Steam boilers also require water being pumped into them. The water requirements for a steam engine depend on its level, with higher levels consuming more water. If water is insufficient, the minimum required fluid transfer rate is shown in the Boiler status. To control the flow of water, you can use a Fluid Pump and a Rotation Speed Controller, or another method for adjusting the pump's speed like an Adjustable Chain Gearshift. This allows you to achieve different fluid transfer rates for different engine levels.

When operating a steam engine, it's important to ensure that you have the correct amount of water flowing through it. For each level of a steam engine, you'll need to supply it with 10mb/t of water, or if the water source directly touches the fluid pumps, you can use the fluid transfer rate to calculate the total rpm. Note that rpm values of more 256 are impossible to reach without changing the upper limit through Configuration. In these cases, you will need to use multiple fluid pumps (e.g. two fluid pumps each set to 180rpm instead of one set to 360):

| Engine Level | Minimum RPM | Maximum RPM |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1            | 20          | 39          |
| 2            | 40          | 59          |
| 3            | 60          | 79          |
| 4            | 80          | 99          |
| 5            | 100         | 119         |
| 6            | 120         | 139         |
| 7            | 140         | 159         |
| 8            | 160         | 179         |
| 9            | 180         | 199         |
| 10           | 200         | 219         |
| 11           | 220         | 239         |
| 12           | 240         | 259         |
| 13           | 260         | 279         |
| 14           | 280         | 299         |
| 15           | 300         | 319         |
| 16           | 320         | 339         |
| 17           | 340         | 359         |
| 18 (Max)     | 360         | 379         |

This equates to ${\textstyle rpm=20\times level}$, but any value where ${\textstyle 20\times level\leq rpm<20\times (level+1)}$ avoids under or oversupplying. However, smaller values consume less Kinetic Stress, so the lower bound is recommended.

### Viewing Power Levels

Power levels can be inspected by viewing the boiler with the Engineer's Goggles or by attaching a Display Link connected to a Display Board. The required water input rate will also be highlighted in this display if insufficient. The levels are shown as a number representing the number of Steam Engines that can be attached.

The maximum number of power levels is 18. Eighteen Steam Engines each producing their maximum power of 16,384 SU gives a maximum boiler stress capacity of 294,912 SU. This can be achieved with the help of Blaze Burners fed Blaze Cakes (Super-heated Blaze Burners). For just a level 9 steam engine without Blaze Cakes, the maximum output is exactly half that amount at 147,456 SU.
