## Usage

In order to begin generating power, a Windmill Bearing must have at least eight Sails, Sail Frames, Wool blocks, or Copycat Panels equipped with wool attached. Any other block can also be attached with Super Glue, though it will not yield any benefit. This will create a Windmill.

By default, the Windmill Bearing spins clockwise, though this can be changed to counter-clockwise with the Wrench. For every 8 sail-type blocks connected to the Windmill Bearing, it gains 1 RPM and 512su (8-15 sails gives 512su at 1 RPM, 16-23 gives 1024su at 2 RPM, etc.). A Windmill will produce a maximum of 8192su (128 sail-type blocks).
