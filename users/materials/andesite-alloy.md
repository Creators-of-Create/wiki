Andesite Alloy is a material used in Andesite Casing and simple kinetic blocks, which serves as an entry-point to the mechanical components of Create. Among its many functions, it is an essential ingredient for crafting Shafts and both regular and large Cogwheels. Andesite Alloy is the most basic construction material for components in Create.

Andesite Alloy cannot be found naturally in the world but can be created through the following methods:

- Placing two Andesite and two Iron/Zinc nuggets in a diagonal 2x2 pattern
- Mixing one Andesite and one Iron/Zinc nugget with a Mixer in a Basin (more efficient)

## Application

Andesite Alloy can be applied to any stripped log manually by right clicking to create Andesite Casings. This process can be automated with the use of Deployers.
