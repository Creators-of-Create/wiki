## Usage

For the Rotation Speed Controller to work, it must be paired with a Large Cogwheel. The Rotation Speed Controller, when powered by the Large Cogwheel, outputs any desired speed of rotational force from its sides. It also does the opposite; when powered from its sides, it controls the speed of the Large Cogwheel.

The rotation speed and direction can be changed in the Value Settings Screen at the front or the back of the machine. The speed can be set to any non-zero integer from -256 to 256.
