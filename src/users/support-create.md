Aside from bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests, you can contribute to the Create endeavors by supporting us
financially.

Please make donations only with the intent to **encourage the people who are working on content you enjoy playing**, not
to gain advantages over other players in regard to your feature suggestions or your in-game experience.

Patreon is a great option to contribute with a monthly payment.  
Your support will be credited at the top of the Project Page, and you will be granted access to an exclusive chatroom on
the Create Discord for hanging out with fellow enthusiastic Create patrons, as well as the team.  
Sometimes we host a little Dev/Art stream in the supporter channel, or send out unreleased builds for play testing.

Alternatively, you can send us some love with a little one-time donation on PayPal.  
The Donation prompt will allow you to pick between a couple of 'programs' you would like to support, such as "Keep
making new Features" or "Host more Community Events".

We'd like to thank everyone that decides to donate, no matter how much. It is greatly appreciated that you put forth
something to help us continue.
