Welcome! This is the page about our current development status and goals, mostly in regard to mod versions and
supported versions of the game.

Sadly, we cannot give out ETA's for future releases. We are not a game studio and progress on this project depends on
many unpredictable factors. Additionally, Specific dates result in a lot higher pressure than you might think, and the
last thing we want is to give up on making features perfect for you just so it can be ready in time.
